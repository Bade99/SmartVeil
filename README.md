# Smart Veil
The main goal of this application is to be able to choose a limit below which pixels will not be opaqued; every other program that I know of will darken every pixel on the screen, the problem with this is that you lose a lot of information about the darker parts of the image when really you only want to lower the brighter sections.

By working with each pixel individually we have a lot more control, at the expense of a little more processing power.

This early prototype is the culmination of two months of off and on research and coding, no optimization has been done yet and there's still a few problems, but the idea and its basis have been clearly set and this works as a very good proof of concept, I hope.

Main problems: TODO

Everything has been done on C++ with the Windows API, Desktop Duplication API and DirectX, any pc with windows 8 o above should be able to run this program (the limitation of OS is due to desktop duplication api).

Feel free to try it, change it, etc. and if you're interested in helping please let me know!
