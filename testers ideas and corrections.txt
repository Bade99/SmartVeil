-App needs visual c++ 2015 x86 or x64 (VCRUNTIME140.dll y MSVCP140.dll)
-most people prefer sliders from 0 to 100%
-gray color for the manager instead of pure black
-custom tooltip text/background color, corresponding with the rest of the ui
-better explain what "reduce high slider values on startup" means
-nobody thinks "threshold" is an intuitive name for the slider
-ask language on first startup
-opacity&threshold presets for different situations
-explain better to the user that minimizing moves the app to the tray instead of the taskbar, maybe with a message, maybe ask the user what he/she prefers
